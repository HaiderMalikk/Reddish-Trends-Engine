"""
This file runs sentiment analysis on Reddit data for a given list of subreddits
and a specific stock symbol. It uses the general_reddit_analysis and
specific_stock_analysis functions from the reddit_analysis module to perform
the analysis.

- It uses the concurrent.futures module to run the analysis functions in parallel.
- This reduces the time for 2 10 post reddit analysis from 50 seconds to 30 seconds as they dont run one after the other.
- each new subreddit analysis for 10 post will take a max of 30 seconds no matter how many subreddits are added.

- it also uses yaspin for spinner to show the progress of the analysis.
- The spinner will show when the analysis is running and will stop when the analysis is completed.
