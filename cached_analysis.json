Because I\u2019m new at this, and have very little knowledge of the market, what would be the best way to allocate that money? I\u2019m thinking I want low-medium risk stocks, I just don\u2019t know which ones would be best.

Comment 4: **System I'm Using (Started January 3rd):**\n\nI use Finviz to filter stocks based on fundamentals and momentum. These are the filters I use:\n\n* **Market Cap**: Over $10 billion\n* **P/E Ratio**: Over 10\n* **EPS Growth (Past 5 Years)**: Positive\n* **Sales Growth (Past 5 Years)**: Over 10%\n* **Debt-to-Equity**: Under 1\n* **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Over 10%\n* **Operating Margin**: I adjust this based on how many stocks pass. \u2003- If too many pass, I raise it by 5% \u2003- If too few pass (under 5 stocks), I lower it by 5%\n* **Price Above SMA50 & SMA200**\n* **RSI**: Under 60\n\nOnce I filter the stocks, I score them based on these 4 categories:\n\n* EPS Growth (higher = better)\n* Debt-to-Equity (lower = better)\n* Operating Margin (higher = better)\n* Distance above SMA50 (higher = better)\n\nEach stock gets points based on how it ranks in those 4 categories. I invest more money in the higher-scoring stocks, and usually hold between **5 and 8 stocks** at a time.\n\n**When I Sell a Stock:**\n\nI sell a stock if:\n\n1. It no longer meets **any one** of the filters above **OR**\n2. A new stock enters that meets all filters and has a higher operating margin, and I already own 8 stocks \u2014 in that case, I remove the stock with the weakest operating margin to stay within my 5\u20138 range.\n\n**Where I'm At:**\n\n* I started the system on **January 3rd**\n* By **February 11th**, I was up **18%**\n* Now it\u2019s **April 2nd**, and I\u2019m **back to breakeven**\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that about **5% of that 18% gain came from one lucky earnings jump**. The rest of the gains were just from following my system. Comment 5: Should I sell my index funds and buy gold until the market is more stable? Comment 6: I just lost 5+% of my retirement in the last two days. I just retired. I\u2019m in a fidelity pre-tax IRA with their \u201cmanagement\u201d services. I don\u2019t know what to do. Any suggestions? Comment 7: I dont have a portfolio lol. Kinda shit myself and sold everything. ill buy bitcoin tomorrow tho Comment 8: New to investing, what are some good stocks to invest in right now since everything is going to shit and will be cheaper to buy? Should I wait and see if they fall farther? I'm willing to invest $100 to start. \n\nEDIT: Should mention, interested in long term only. Day trading and short term trading seem too much like gambling to me, and I don't want to get stupid with my money. Comment 9: Long term investor, investing in a Roth IRA.
